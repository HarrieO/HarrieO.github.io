I am an assistant professor at the [Data Science Group](https://www.ru.nl/datascience/) of the [Institute of Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)](https://www.ru.nl/icis/) of the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/).
My research lies on the intersection of machine learning and information retrieval, it primarily concerns learning from user interactions on rankings.
In particular, I focus on methods that correct for the effects of interaction biases.

My Research Topics
------
I'm passionate about research in *Machine Learning* and *Information Retrieval*; in particular how search and recommendation systems can learn from user interactions.
While the goals of these systems if often to follow users' preferences, the interactions of users are often affected by many other factors: e.g. what items are shown, the order in which they are shown, etc.
As a result, these methods have to correct for these _interaction biases_.
My research often uses theoretical methods for counterfactual estimation with machine learning approaches to optimize ranking systems.

On the long term, I hope my research contributes to ranking systems that can better satisfy and understand diverse user preferences that also consider the societal impact of their behavior (e.g. ranking fairness, the spreading misinformation or harmful ideas).
