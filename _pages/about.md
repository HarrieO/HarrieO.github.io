I am an assistant professor at the [Data Science Group](https://www.ru.nl/datascience/) of the [Institute of Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)](https://www.ru.nl/icis/) of the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/).
My research lies on the intersection of machine learning and information retrieval, it primarily concerns learning from user interactions on rankings.
In particular, I focus on methods that correct for the effects of interaction biases.
